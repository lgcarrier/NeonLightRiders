# Neon Light Riders - Game Design Document

## Game Overview
- **Title**: Neon Light Riders
- **Genre**: Single-player 3D Racing/Combat with AI
- **Platform**: Web Browser (WebGL/ThreeJS)
- **Target Audience**: 13+ players who enjoy competitive multiplayer racing games
- **Art Style**: Retro-futuristic, neon-lit cyberpunk aesthetic

## Core Gameplay Mechanics
### Light Trail System
- Players leave persistent light trails behind their vehicles
- Trails act as solid walls that players must avoid
- Trails do not fade over time
- Collision with trails results in elimination

### Movement & Controls
- WASD/Arrow keys for directional control
- Smooth, physics-based movement using ThreeJS
- Quick turning mechanics for tactical maneuvers
- Optional boost mechanic with cooldown

### AI Opponents
- Three AI-controlled opponents per match
- Dynamic AI behavior patterns and strategies
- AI opponents use pathfinding to avoid trails

## Technical Architecture
### 3D Graphics (ThreeJS)
- Low-poly art style for optimal performance
- Dynamic lighting system for trails
- Particle effects for explosions and boosts
- LOD implementation for distant objects

### Networking
- Client-server architecture with authoritative server
- Delta-compressed updates for efficient bandwidth usage
- Client-side prediction and reconciliation
- Room-based instancing for scalability

### Game Logic
- Client-side game processing
- Deterministic AI decision making
- State management for single player progression
- Local save system for player stats and preferences

## Game Modes
