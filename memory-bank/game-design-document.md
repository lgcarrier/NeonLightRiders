# Neon Light Riders - Game Design Document

## Game Overview
- **Title**: Neon Light Riders
- **Genre**: Single-player 3D arcade game with AI opponents
- **Platform**: Web Browser (WebGL/Three.js)
- **Target Audience**: 13+ players who enjoy fast-paced arcade games
- **Art Style**: Retro-futuristic, neon-lit cyberpunk aesthetic

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Light Trail System
- Players leave persistent light trails behind their bikes
- Trails act as solid walls that players must avoid
- Trails do not fade over time
- Collision with trails results in bike explosion
- Optional setting to keep trails on the grid after a bike explodes, increasing difficulty

### Movement & Controls
- Left/Right arrow keys for directional control (90Â° turns)
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Smooth, grid-based movement using Three.js
- Constant forward motion

### AI Opponents
- Up to 3 AI-controlled opponents
- Configurable difficulty 
- AI opponents use collision avoidance strategies

### Round System
- Multiple rounds of gameplay
- Score tracking across rounds
- Progressive difficulty system
- Winner determined by total score

## Technical Implementation

### 3D Graphics (Three.js)
- Grid-based arena with neon aesthetics
- Dynamic lighting system for trails
- Particle effects for explosions
- Custom camera system with spectator mode

### Game Architecture
- Component-based architecture
- Modular code organization
- Client-side game processing
- State management for game progression

### Physics and Collision
- Grid-based collision detection
- Real-time collision response
- Multiple collision types (wall, trail, bike)

## Game Features

### Camera System
- Follow camera for player bike
- Spectator mode after player death
- Camera switching in ghost mode

### Interface Elements
- Radar map showing position of all bikes
- Score display and round information
- Minimalist HUD design
- Touch controls for mobile devices

### Audio System
- Background music
- Sound effects for game events
- Spatial audio for explosions and bikes

## Visual Design

### Environment
- Cyber-grid floor with neon accents
- Dark background with grid visualization
- Minimal obstacles for pure gameplay focus
- Color scheme: Dark base with bright neon highlights

### Player Bikes
- Distinct colored light cycles for each player
- Bright neon trails matching bike color
- Explosion effects upon collision
- Visual feedback for turning and movement

## UI/UX

### In-Game HUD
- Minimalist design
- Score and round information
- Radar map showing player positions
- Countdown timers for round start

### Menus
- Clean, neon-styled interface
- Start game and settings options
- Game over screen with results
- Round transition screens

## Game Settings

### Configurable Options
- Self-collision toggle (whether bikes can collide with their own trails)
- Trail delay (time before trails start appearing)
- Persistent trails (option to keep trails after a bike explodes)
- Debug mode for development

## Current Implementation Status

### Implemented Features
- Core bike movement and controls
- Trail generation system
- Collision detection and response
- AI opponents with basic avoidance
- Round management system
- Radar map for player tracking
- Score tracking
- Explosion effects
- Ghost/spectator mode
- Mobile touch controls

### Planned Enhancements
- Additional game modes (time trial, survival)
- More advanced AI behaviors
- Enhanced visual effects
- Sound design improvements
- Performance optimizations

## Development Priorities
1. User experience refinements
2. Mobile control improvements
3. Visual and audio polish
4. Additional game modes
5. Performance optimization

This document will be updated as development progresses.
