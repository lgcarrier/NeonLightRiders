3. Set up physics time step
   - Test: Physics updates run at fixed intervals
   - Test: Objects move consistently regardless of frame rate

## Phase 3: Player Vehicle
1. Create vehicle model and controls
   - Test: WASD/Arrow keys move vehicle
   - Test: Vehicle rotates smoothly
   - Test: Collision bounds are accurate

2. Implement light trail system
   - Test: Trail follows vehicle exactly
   - Test: Trail persists in world
   - Test: Trail segments connect seamlessly

3. Add collision detection
   - Test: Vehicle detects trail collisions
   - Test: Vehicle detects arena boundary collisions
   - Test: No false positives/negatives in collision

## Phase 4: AI Opponents
1. Create basic AI movement
   - Test: AI moves without getting stuck
   - Test: AI stays within arena bounds

2. Implement trail avoidance
   - Test: AI detects nearby trails
   - Test: AI successfully avoids trails
   - Test: AI doesn't make impossible turns

3. Add basic strategy
   - Test: AI attempts to cut off players
   - Test: AI chooses efficient paths
   - Test: AI doesn't collide with itself

## Phase 5: Game States
1. Implement game state machine
   - Test: States transition correctly
   - Test: Game can reset properly
   - Test: State persistence works

2. Add win/lose conditions
   - Test: Game ends on collision
   - Test: Last survivor wins
   - Test: Score updates correctly

3. Create basic UI
   - Test: Game state is visible
   - Test: UI updates reflect game state
   - Test: Restart game works

## Phase 6: Arena
1. Create basic arena
   - Test: Boundaries are visible
   - Test: Lighting works correctly
   - Test: Grid floor renders properly

2. Add visual effects
   - Test: Trail glow effects work
   - Test: Explosion effects trigger
   - Test: Particle systems don't impact performance

3. Implement basic sound
   - Test: Engine sounds play
   - Test: Collision sounds work
   - Test: Audio doesn't delay gameplay

## Phase 7: Testing & Optimization
1. Performance testing
   - Test: 60 FPS maintained with 4 players
   - Test: No memory leaks after multiple games
   - Test: Asset loading doesn't cause stutters

2. Browser compatibility
   - Test: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Test: Consistent behavior across browsers
   - Test: Graceful fallback for unsupported features

3. Input validation
   - Test: Controls work on different keyboards
   - Test: No input lag
   - Test: Multiple simultaneous inputs handled correctly

## Phase 8: Polish
1. Add game feel improvements
   - Test: Camera shake on collision
   - Test: Screen flash effects work
   - Test: Smooth transitions between states

2. Implement basic settings
   - Test: Volume controls work
   - Test: Graphics options apply correctly
   - Test: Settings persist between sessions

3. Final quality pass
   - Test: No visual glitches
   - Test: Consistent frame timing
   - Test: Clean state management
